# Improve Your VS Code Experience with the `aaron-bond.better-comments` Extension.
# Default Environment Variable Values. Define default values for environment variables required to run the app.
# Overriding Defaults. These defaults can be overridden by environment-specific .env files, such as .env.development,
# and local .env files like .env.local and .env.development.local.
# Important: No Secrets Here. Never store secrets in this file. Store sensitive information in a .env.local file
# or an environment-specific local .env file, like .env.development.local or .env.test.local.
# Do not commit these local env files to source control.
# Getting Started. If you're new or cloning the repo, use the ".env.example" file as a template to create your ".env" file.
# Keep this file current when adding new variables to `.env`.
# Use Caution When Committing. Remember that this file will be committed to version control. Ensure it does not contain secrets.
# When cloning this repo, create a copy named ".env" and add your secrets.
# Schema Updates. When adding new environment variables, update the schema in "/src/env.mjs" accordingly.

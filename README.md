<!-- TOC end -->

_The section will be improved soon. You can use [this service](https://derlin.github.io/bitdowntoc) (with GitHub preset selected) if you need to update current `README.md` file. VS Code extensions also has good automatic TOC generating._

## 07. Recommendations & Why We Use This And That

_The section will be implemented soon._

Currently we don't use Contentlayer. It still unstable with Windows. For this reason we currently trying to implement options for choosing to use or not to use Contentlayer in the `src/app.ts` configuration file. In the future, maybe, we are develop our very own solution for the content writing. External providers, like Sanity, also possibly will be implemented in the future with corresponding options to enable/disable.

We recommend to clean browser cache and delete `.next` folder from time to time, to ensure that if everything works as expected.

![Bleverse Relivator OG Image](/public/og-image.png)

## 08. [Bun](https://bun.sh) Support & Compatibility

The `Relivator` already can be used with some `Bun` awesome features. Currently we recommend to use `pnpm` for this starter. We try to ship the full as possible Bun support and compatibility as soon as the Windows binaries will be released.

_The section will be expanded soon._

## 09. Internationalization (i18n)

At Bleverse, the approach to multilingualism is a separate Holy Grail. We love to talk about this topic. In the future, we will write a lot of interesting things about Next.js 13 App Router internationalization.

**Hint:** Use `pnpm lint:i18n` to check if your i18n files are okay. It also tries to fix some things if possible with tools e.g. it provides the ascending sort. If you got nothing on output it means everything is okay.

Currently, all languages have machine translation. In the future, we plan to have them checked by native speakers.

Please note that the project currently has i18n messages from another of our open source projects. They will be removed in the next few days.

This section will be expanded accordingly in the future. Stay tuned!

**Current Locales** _(asc sort)_

- 🇩🇪: "German",
- 🇬🇧: "English",
- 🇪🇸: "Spanish",
- 🇫🇷: "French",
- 🇮🇹: "Italian",
- 🇵🇱: "Polish",
- 🇹🇷: "Turkish",
- 🇺🇦: "Ukrainian",

## 10. Project Configuration

The `src/app.ts` file contains essential configuration used to modify the contents and settings of the website.

- Manage the content displayed on the website.
- Customize various settings, such as disabling the theme toggle.
- Manage general site-wide information.

## 11. NextAuth.js Authentication

Setting up auth is easy as a breeze...

_The section will be implemented soon._

## 12. Environment variables

**This section will be more clean and improved soon. Please stay tuned.**

Define default values for environment variables required to run the app. Never store secrets in `.env.example` file. Store sensitive information in a `.env` file only. Do not commit these local env files to source control. If you're new or cloning the repo, use the `.env.example` file as a template to create your `.env` file. Keep this file current when adding new variables to `.env`. Use Caution When Committing. Remember that this file will be committed to version control. Ensure it does not contain secrets. When cloning this repo, create a copy named `.env` and add your secrets. When adding new environment variables, update the schema in `/src/env.mjs` accordingly.

You can [read more about environment variables here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables).

`.env.example` file was simplified so much with the 1.0.0 Relivator release, and will be even more simplified in the next versions. We plan to implement if the specific value is not specified, then the app will still be fine compiled by disabling this env related functional.

## 14. Database

Drizzle ORM in the Relivator is set up to use be ready for serverless environments by default. The project build with [PostgresJS](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/quick-postgresql/postgresjs) and uses `[pg](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/quick-postgresql/node-postgres)` ([docs](https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver#pool-or-client)), so any PostgreSQL-like supported database services will work. Everything in the project currently set up serverless using [@neondatabase/serverless](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/quick-postgresql/neon). Simply set `DATABASE_URL` in created by you `.env` file and you are ready to go. You can learn more about it in the [env related section](#12-environment-variables) of this readme.

If you want to use another serverless provider, like [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres), just instead of [@neondatabase/serverless](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/quick-postgresql/neon) package use [@vercel/postgres](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/quick-postgresql/vercel) everywhere and you can still use `[postgres](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/quick-postgresql/postgresjs)` or `[pg](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/quick-postgresql/node-postgres)` driver in the`drizzle.config.ts` file.

If you need a serverful architecture (which [is not recommended](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/serverless/traditional-vs-serverless-databases) and it is [the old thing](https://www.locofy.ai/blog/serverful-vs-serverless)), just remove ``from the app and just use only [PostgresJS](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/quick-postgresql/postgresjs), and set the driver to `[pg](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/quick-postgresql/node-postgres)` in the`drizzle.config.ts` file.

### 1. `pnpm db` automatization

This project exposes a package.json script for accessing drizzle-kit via `pnpm db:<command>`. This script handles all environment variable mapping automatically via `dotenv-cli`, so you don't have to think about it. You should always try to use this script when interacting with drizzle-kit locally.

**Note:** Don't delete any files in `migrations` folder manually, please refer to [pnpm db:drop](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/commands#drop-migration) command.

### 2. Making changes to the database schema ([learn more](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/sql-schema-declaration))

1. [optional] Make changes to your database by declaring or modifying the `*.ts` files of prototypes in `src/data/db` folder.

2. [optional] After declaring or modifying database prototypes you will then use `pnpm db:generate`.

3. [recommended] You can run the `pnpm db:push` after a double checking the new generated files in the `drizzle` folder. If something wrong **please don't delete the files inside `drizzle` folder by yourself and use `pnpm db:drop` instead, manual removing can crash Drizzle, [as its developers said](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/conf#migrations-folder)**. And when you feel comfortable with the changes, you can then send the SQL generated files code to your database provider. _Recommended to run this after cloning the repo and creating your new database in the chosen by you database service._

4. [optional] For migrations you can use the `pnpm db:migrate` command. Currently [@tsx](https://github.com/esbuild-kit/tsx#readme) package is used. It will be replaced by Bun when the Windows builds will be featured. And please note: **don't add** the `drizzle` folder into the `.gitignore`, as the developers and users answering on the official Drizzle Discord ([#1](https://discord.com/channels/1043890932593987624/1091522180711460914/1091524538795315250) | [#2](https://discord.com/channels/1043890932593987624/1043890932593987627/1134173040918396978)).

5. [optional] You can generate products for created store by you. In the development environment just use `Generate` button to do this (using `src/server/actions/generate.ts` file). In the future you will can also populate your newly created database with some random data by running the `pnpm db:seed` command (the `src/data/env/seed.ts` file is currently under the development).

### tRPC

tRPC is ready to be used with Drizzle schemas. At the moment `todos` model made to work with tRPC, but still improvements needed. These todos are planned to be used as checklists on some user's store pages, like shipping management. We can also use this for the `Roadmap Changelog` page in the frontend of app with admin privilegies to add, edit and mark things there.

## 15. How to Deploy the Project

## 16. Migration From Similar Starter

Know how to migrate your project to the current starter. Migration guides are both for app and pages directories. Your old starter may use Prisma, Zod, and other things.

The content of this section is not yet ready. Check back in a few days. Possible will be moved to [the project wiki](https://github.com/blefnk/relivator/wiki). Possible stacks: [Original Next.js 13 Boilerplate](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-boilerplate), [Original T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg), [Shadcn Taxonomy](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/taxonom), [Vercel Store](https://vercel.store), [SkateShop](https://github.com/sadmann7/skateshop), [OneStopShop](https://github.com/jackblatch/OneStopShop), [Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa), [and so on](https://github.com/blefnk/relivator/wiki/Project-Credits-&-Contributors).

## 17. UI components

By default, this project already includes some components from some component libraries, and also unstyled [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) components. The shadcn/ui even allows you generate the new UI components by using its CLI:

```sh
pnpm dlx shadcn-ui@latest add button
```

Where `button` can be any UI element from the project.

## 19. Say Thank You to Them

If you've ever wondered which Next.js starter to choose for your next project, especially when it comes to scaling an online store, whether it's [Vercel Store](https://vercel.store), [SkateShop](https://github.com/sadmann7/skateshop), [OneStopShop](https://github.com/jackblatch/OneStopShop), [Taxonomy](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/taxonomy)/[nextflix](https://github.com/Apestein/nextflix), [Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa), [and so on](https://github.com/blefnk/relivator/wiki/Project-Credits-&-Contributors), — then stop right here.

But **if you need a MONSTER**, a tool for all life situations, then _Relivator is definitely what you need to fork or use as template_ right now! Relivator already includes a lot of things from all those starters, and even-even more! It aims to break all possible boundaries of Next.js and React capabilities. With Relivator, your hands are completely free.

All of these projects are incredibly amazing, and if you're into minimalism, we're highly recommend checking them out ❤️. The creators of these starters are super-mega-cool people, and we're endlessly thank them all 🙏; without them, this starter wouldn't exist.

### 21.02. What Relivator means?

The author of this project, [@blefnk](https://github.com/blefnk), was teleported to the central universe of the Bleverse, short for the Blefonix Multiverse. There, he met a few individuals who informed him that this central universe is known as Relivator. A rumor circulates that within Relivator exists a tree. Those who have seen this tree claim to have heard echoes that sounded like `ré-li-vá-to`, which inspired both the name of the tree and of Relivator itself. The author is also writing a book based on the stories told to him by the inhabitants of Relivator and the entire Bleverse. An excerpt from this book will soon be [available in its own repository](https://github.com/blefnk/bleversum).
